#  Netflix Clone (iOS Dev)

I want to start learning native iOS development with XCode, thus I'm creating this project based on this (tutorial)[https://youtu.be/KCgYDCKqato].

I will use this README file as a notes/journal throughout my iOS dev journey. I'll write about things that I've learned, my impression of native iOS dev vs hybrid (as I'm coming from React/React Native).


## Video 1
There are a few things I want to jot down here after I've completed the first chapter of the videos. Since this is the first time I'm using XCode as a dev tools, here's what I've noticed. 

**1. Connecting project to GitHub is somewhat the same as VSCode.** 

I'm actually expecting XCode would have a better source control integration compared to VSCode. But it seems like it's pretty much the same. I thought there is a way that I can initialize my repo on GitHub using XCode. Turns out, I need to go through the exact same process as if I were using VSCode. I wasn't disappointed, it was underwhelming haha.

**2. Making commits and staging codes is different but I think I can get used to it.**

Obviously I'm biased here but the way XCode handles committing and staging is somewhat weird. I couldn't fint the "staging" option when I clicked on "Source Control". There were only commit, push, pull, and stash. I was confused with it. Then I discovered that I need to "tick âœ…" on the files that I want to commit, that is essentially how I stage it. I mean it's fine but yeah, it was different.

**3. Creating README is weird.**

When I was trying to create a README file for this project. I thought I can just go to GitHub and add it there, then Pull the changes here on XCode. But nothing happens when I did that. After some googling, it seems like I need to create the file in here first if I want it to be shown in XCode. That was just straight up weird. Because I know the file do exist, I manage to get the README from GitHub to my machine but somehow it did not show up in XCode. But after I "create" it in XCode, now it showed. And I'm actually modifiying the file from GitHub anyway. I just don't understand why I need to "create" it first.


**4. I didn't know we need to "Build" the app if I want to see the changes.**

I'm a bit worried about this because I know the "Build" process will take longer as the app grows. I really did not expect it to be this way as I was very familar with "hot-reloading" that I get with React Native. Now I understand why one of my colleague was very surprised to see that I was able to just restart the app if I want to see changes with my React Native app. I assume they don't have that in Android too.
